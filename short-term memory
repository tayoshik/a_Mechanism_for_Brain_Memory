The concepts of consciousness, unconsciousness, and their boundaries can be explained in terms of retention time in short-term memory (STM). In this technical explanation

Consciousness: This is characterized by a retention time in short-term memory that is long enough for the individual to become aware of the information.
Here, the neural activity associated with the memory trace remains active long enough to be processed by higher cognitive functions, allowing the individual to consciously recognize the information and consciously process it computationally and synthetically with other stored information.

Unconscious processing: In this state, retention time in short-term memory is very short and information cannot be consciously recognized. Memory traces often fade quickly before being consciously processed, resulting in information being stored without conscious recognition or computed or synthesized without conscious awareness.

Boundary Region: This is the transitional region between conscious and unconscious processing. In this region, the retention time of short-term memory is neither too short to be fully unconscious nor too long to be fully conscious. Information in this state may be partially recognized or vaguely recalled and may influence behavior and thought without the individual being fully aware of its origin.

This model provides a framework for understanding how different types of cognitive processes, such as awareness, recall, and unconscious influences, relate to the temporal characteristics of short-term memory retention.
