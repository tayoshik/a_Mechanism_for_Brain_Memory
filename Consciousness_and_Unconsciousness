Consciousness and Unconsciousness in the Human Cognitive System: A Continuous Layered Structure
Summary
This paper proposes a new theory that the human cognitive system consists of two layers, the conscious (significant consciousness) and the unconscious, but the boundary between the two layers is continuous and there is no clear division between them. The unconscious constantly receives signals from the body's neural circuits and processes information based on these signals. On the other hand, the significant consciousness processes only the information from the unconscious in a display system called cognition, and recognizes the voluntary movement commands issued by the unconscious as if they were issued by the significant consciousness, and consequently performs voluntary movements. This theory suggests that the unconscious plays the leading role in the cognitive system and the significant consciousness is subordinate to it.

Role and Function of the Unconscious
The unconscious constantly receives signals via the body's neural circuits. These signals come from inside the body and from the outside world, and the unconscious continues to receive these signals without interruption. The unconscious functions as its own storage medium and has the ability to generate new information based on the stored information and store it again in the storage medium.

Role and function of the conscious mind
The conscious mind controls thoughts and sensations that we can directly perceive, but its information processing depends on information transmitted from the unconscious mind. The conscious mind can process information only when commanded to do so by the unconscious mind, and can provide information to the display system of cognition.

Voluntary and Accompanying Movements
The unconscious prompts humans to move, which includes voluntary and incidental movements. One would think that voluntary movements are also performed by the conscious mind, which is part of the unconscious, but in fact they are controlled by the unconscious. When the unconscious determines that it needs to work with the conscious, that work is recognized as significant. Thought is a type of voluntary movement.

Relationship between the unconscious and the conscious
The central contention of this theory is that the unconscious plays the leading role in the cognitive system and that the significant consciousness is subordinate to the unconscious. The unconscious acts on the significant consciousness only when it deems it necessary, and this always gives people the illusion that the significant consciousness is executing voluntary movements. Thus, unconscious control is the basis of cognitive behavior.

Conclusion
This theory proposes a continuous layered structure of consciousness and unconsciousness in the human cognitive system and suggests that the unconscious plays a leading role. This perspective provides new insights into conventional cognitive science and is expected to serve as a foundation for further research.
